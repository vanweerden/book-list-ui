## Book List UI
This is a front end interface for my book-list app (an EXTREMELY basic GoodReads-style CRUD app).

### Built with
* [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)
* [React JS](https://reactjs.org/) version 16.13
* Vanilla CSS (i.e. no frameworks used)

### Status
I have added create, read, and delete functionality. I still need to add a way to update entries. I also need to add a way to create an account and sign in if I ever want to deploy it.
