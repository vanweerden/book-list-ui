## Book List UI
This is a front end interface for my [book-list app](https://github.com/vanweerden/book-list) (an EXTREMELY basic GoodReads-style CRUD app).

### Built with
* [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)
* [React JS](https://reactjs.org/) version 16.13
* Vanilla CSS (i.e. no frameworks used)

### Status
Updated: 25 July 2020
Basic functionality complete! Book can now be created, updated, and deleted from
the UI. 

Next I am going to do some refactoring (I violated the DRY principle by using two different forms for editing and adding books) and give it a CSS makeover.
